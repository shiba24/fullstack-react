# Fullstack react

Personal note of fullstack react.

# 1. First react application

- `render()` is the only required method for a React component.

```js
class HelloWorld extends React.Component { render() { return        (<p>Hello, world!</p>) }
}
```

- In JSX, you can write values as like in html format, instead of `React.createElement` .
